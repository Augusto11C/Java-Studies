## Passing a Parameter to a Generic Type
```java
public class ReverseComparator<T> implements Comparator<T> {
	private final Comparator<T> delegateComparator;

	public ReverseComparator(final Comparator<T> delegateComparator) {
		this.delegateComparator = delegateComparator;
	}
	
	public int compare(final T left, final T right) {
		return -1 * delegateComparator.compare(left, right);
	}
}
```
What this sintaxe is saying is: There is a `ReverseComparator` class that is generic (it got the generic type parameter **T**), and implements a generic interface `Comparator` that receives the same generic parameter (**T**), from ReverseComparator.

> Here we are passing on this **T** up the chain

### PECS (Producer Extends Consumer Super)
> "PECS" is from the collection's point of view. If you are only pulling items from a generic collection, it is a producer and you should use extends; if you are only stuffing items in, it is a consumer and you should use super. If you do both with the same collection, you shouldn't use either extends or super.
> \- [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2723397/what-is-pecs-producer-extends-consumer-super)

Suppose you have a method that takes as its parameter a collection of things, but you want it to be more flexible than just accepting a `Collection<Thing>`.

**Case 1[Producer][Read From][Upper bound]:** You want to go through the collection and do things with each item.
Then the list is a producer, so you should use a Collection<? extends Thing>.

The reasoning is that a `Collection<? extends Thing>` could hold any subtype of `Thing`, and thus each element will behave as a `Thing` when you perform your operation. (You actually cannot add anything to a `Collection<? extends Thing>`, because you cannot know at runtime which specific subtype of `Thing` the collection holds.)

**Case 2[Lower bound]: You want to add things to the collection.**  
Then the list is a  **consumer**, so you should use a  `Collection<? super Thing>`.

The reasoning here is that unlike  `Collection<? extends Thing>`,  `Collection<? super Thing>`  can always hold a  `Thing`  no matter what the actual parameterized type is. Here you don't care what is already in the list as long as it will allow a  `Thing`  to be added; this is what  `? super Thing`  guarantees.

### Lower Bound
Say you want to write a method that puts  Integer  objects into a list. To maximize flexibility, you would like the method to work on  List<Integer>,  List<Number>, and  List<Object>  â€” anything that can hold  Integer  values.

To write the method that works on lists of  Integer  and the supertypes of  Integer, such as  Integer,  Number, and  Object, you would specify  List<? super Integer>. The term  List<Integer>  is more restrictive than  List<? super Integer>  because the former matches a list of type  Integer  only, whereas the latter matches a list of any type that is a supertype of  Integer.

The following code adds the numbers 1 through 10 to the end of a list:

```java
public static void addNumbers(List<? super Integer> list) {
    for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
        list.add(i);
    }
}
```

You can't read the specific type T (e.g.  `Number`) from  `List<? super T>`  because you can't guarantee what kind of  `List`  it is really pointing to. The only "guarantee" you have is you are able to add a value of type  `T`  (or any superclass of  `T`) without violating the integrity of the list being pointed to.

```java
 List<? super Integer> listSuperInteger_ListNumber  = new ArrayList<Number>();
 List<? super Integer> listSuperInteger_ListInteger = new ArrayList<Integer>();
//List<? super Integer> listSuperInteger_ListDouble  = new ArrayList<Double>();     // error - Double is not a superclass of Integer

listSuperNumber_ListNumber.add(3);       // ok - allowed to add Integer to List<Number> or List<Object>
```

### Upper Bound
You can use an upper bounded wildcard to relax the restrictions on a variable. For example, say you want to write a method that works on `List<Integer>`, `List<Double>`, and  `List<Number>`; you can achieve this by using an upper bounded wildcard.

To write the method that works on lists of Number and the subtypes of Number, such as Integer, Double, and Float, you would specify `List<? extends Number>`. The term `List<Number>` is more restrictive than `List<? extends Number>` because the former matches a list of type Number only, whereas the latter matches a list of type Number or any of its subclasses.

The  sumOfList  method returns the sum of the numbers in a list:
```java
public static double sumOfList(List<? extends Number> list) {
    double s = 0.0;
    for (Number n : list)
        s += n.doubleValue();
    return s;
}
```

You can't add any object to  `List<? extends T>`  because you can't guarantee what kind of  `List`  it is really pointing to, so you can't guarantee that the object is allowed in that  `List`. The only "guarantee" is that you can only read from it and you'll get a  `T`  or subclass of  `T`.

```java
//List<? extends Integer> listExtendsInteger_ListNumber  = new ArrayList<Number>(); // error - Number is not a subclass of Integer
List<? extends Integer> listExtendsInteger_ListInteger = new ArrayList<Integer>();
//List<? extends Integer> listExtendsInteger_ListDouble  = new ArrayList<Double>(); // error - Double is not a subclass of Integer

// More examples below

List<? extends Number> listExtendsNumber_ListNumber  = new ArrayList<Number>();
List<? extends Number> listExtendsNumber_ListInteger = new ArrayList<Integer>();
List<? extends Number> listExtendsNumber_ListDouble  = new ArrayList<Double>();

//listExtendsNumber_ListNumber.add(3);     // error - can't add Integer to *possible* List<Double>, even though it is really List<Number>
//listExtendsNumber_ListInteger.add(3);    // error - can't add Integer to *possible* List<Double>, even though it is really List<Integer>
//listExtendsNumber_ListDouble.add(3);     // error - can't add Integer to *possible* List<Double>, especially since it is really List<Double>


```


### Example - `Collections.copy()`
```java
public static <T> void copy(List<? super T> dest,List<? extends T> src)
```

## [Java Generics WildCard: <? extends Number> vs <T extends Number>](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11497020/java-generics-wildcard-extends-number-vs-t-extends-number)
`T` is a bounded type, i.e. whatever type you use, you have to stick to that particular type which extends `Number`, e.g. if you pass a `Double` type to a list, you cannot pass it a `Short` type as `T` is of type `Double` and the list is already bounded by that type. In contrast, if you use `?` (`wildcard`), you can use "any" type that extends `Number` (add both `Short` and `Double` to that list).


## [Is there a generic class that accepts either of two types?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9141960/generic-class-that-accepts-either-of-two-types)
The answer is no. At least there is no way to do it using generic types. I would recommend a combination of generics and factory methods to do what you want.
```java
class MyGenericClass<T extends Number> {
  public static MyGenericClass<Long> newInstance(Long value) {
    return new MyGenericClass<Long>(value);
  }

  public static MyGenericClass<Integer> newInstance(Integer value) {
    return new MyGenericClass<Integer>(value);
  }

  // hide constructor so you have to use factory methods
  private MyGenericClass(T value) {
    // implement the constructor
  }
  // ... implement the class
  public void frob(T number) {
    // do something with T
  }
}
```

##  [Java nested generic type](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22806202/java-nested-generic-type)

Fundamentally,  `List<List<?>>`  and  `List<? extends List<?>>`  have distinct type arguments.

It's actually the case that one is a subtype of the other, but first let's learn more about what they mean individually.

### Understanding semantic differences

Generally speaking, the wildcard  `?`  represents some "missing information". It means  _"there was a type argument here once, but we don't know what it is anymore"_. And because we don't know what it is, restrictions are imposed on how we can use anything that refers to that particular type argument.

For the moment, let's simplify the example by using  `List`  instead of  `Map`.

-   A  `List<List<?>>`  holds  _any kind of List with any type argument_. So i.e.:
    
    ```java
    List<List<?>> theAnyList = new ArrayList<List<?>>();
    
    // we can do this
    theAnyList.add( new ArrayList<String>() );
    theAnyList.add( new LinkedList<Integer>() );
    
    List<?> typeInfoLost = theAnyList.get(0);
    // but we are prevented from doing this
    typeInfoLost.add( new Integer(1) );
    ```
    
    We can put any  `List`  in  `theAnyList`, but by doing so we have lost knowledge of  _their elements_.
    
-   When we use  `? extends`, the  `List`  holds  _some specific subtype of List, but we don't know what it is anymore_. So i.e.:
    
    ```java
    List<? extends List<Float>> theNotSureList =
        new ArrayList<ArrayList<Float>>();
    
    // we can still use its elements
    // because we know they store Float
    List<Float> aFloatList = theNotSureList.get(0);
    aFloatList.add( new Float(1.0f) );
    
    // but we are prevented from doing this
    theNotSureList.add( new LinkedList<Float>() );
    ```
    
    It's no longer safe to add anything to the  `theNotSureList`, because we don't know the actual type of its elements. (_Was_  it originally a  `List<LinkedList<Float>>`? Or a  `List<Vector<Float>>`? We don't know.)
    
-   We can put these together and have a  `List<? extends List<?>>`. We don't know what type of  `List`  it has in it anymore, and we don't know the element type of  _those_  `List`s either. So i.e.:
    
    ```java
    List<? extends List<?>> theReallyNotSureList;
    
    // these are fine
    theReallyNotSureList = theAnyList;
    theReallyNotSureList = theNotSureList;
    
    // but we are prevented from doing this
    theReallyNotSureList.add( new Vector<Float>() );
    // as well as this
    theReallyNotSureList.get(0).add( "a String" );
    ```
    
    We've lost information  _both_  about  `theReallyNotSureList`,  _as well as_  the element type of the  `List`s inside it.
    
    (But you may note that we can  _assign_  any kind of  _List holding Lists_  to it...)
    

So to break it down:

```
//   â”Œ applies to the "outer" List
//   â–¼
List<? extends List<?>>
//                  â–²
//                  â”” applies to the "inner" List
```

The  `Map`  works the same way, it just has more type parameters:

```
//  â”Œ Map K argument
//  â”‚  â”Œ Map V argument
//  â–¼  â–¼
Map<?, ? extends List<?>>
//                    â–²
//                    â”” List E argument
```

### Why  `? extends`  is necessary

You may know that  ["concrete"](http://www.angelikalanger.com/GenericsFAQ/FAQSections/ParameterizedTypes.html#FAQ101)  generic types have  _invariance_, that is,  [`List<Dog>`  is not a subtype of  `List<Animal>`](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2745265/is-listdog-a-subclass-of-listanimal-why-arent-javas-generics-implicitly-p)  even if  `class Dog extends Animal`. Instead, the wildcard is how we have  _covariance_, that is,  `List<Dog>`  _is_  a subtype of  `List<? extends Animal>`.

```
// Dog is a subtype of Animal
class Animal {}
class Dog extends Animal {}

// List<Dog> is a subtype of List<? extends Animal>
List<? extends Animal> a = new ArrayList<Dog>();

// all parameterized Lists are subtypes of List<?>
List<?> b = a;
```

So applying these ideas to a nested  `List`:

-   `List<String>`  is a subtype of  `List<?>`  but  `List<List<String>>`  is  _not_  a subtype of  `List<List<?>>`. As shown before, this prevents us from compromising type safety by adding wrong elements to the  `List`.
-   `List<List<String>>`  _is_  a subtype of  `List<? extends List<?>>`, because the bounded wildcard allows covariance. That is,  `? extends`  allows the fact that  `List<String>`  is a subtype of  `List<?>`  to be considered.
-   `List<? extends List<?>>`  is in fact a shared supertype:
    
    ```
         List<? extends List<?>>
              â•±          â•²
    List<List<?>>    List<List<String>>
    ```
    

### In review

1.  `Map<Integer, List<String>>`  accepts  _only_  `List<String>`  as a value.
2.  `Map<?, List<?>>`  accepts  _any_  `List`  as a value.
3.  `Map<Integer, List<String>>`  and  `Map<?, List<?>>`  are distinct types which have separate semantics.
4.  One cannot be converted to the other, to prevent us from doing modifications in an unsafe way.
5.  `Map<?, ? extends List<?>>`  is a shared supertype which imposes safe restrictions:
    
    ```
            Map<?, ? extends List<?>>
                 â•±          â•²
    Map<?, List<?>>     Map<Integer, List<String>>
    ```
    

----------

### How the generic method works

By using a type parameter on the method, we can assert that  `List`  has some concrete type.

```
static <E> void test(Map<?, List<E>> m) {}
```

This particular declaration requires that  _all_  `List`s in the  `Map`  have the same element type. We don't know what that type actually  _is_, but we can use it in an abstract manner. This allows us to perform "blind" operations.

For example, this kind of declaration might be useful for some kind of accumulation:

```
static <E> List<E> test(Map<?, List<E>> m) {
    List<E> result = new ArrayList<E>();

    for(List<E> value : m.values()) {
        result.addAll(value);
    }

    return result;
}
```

We can't call  `put`  on  `m`  because we don't know what its  _key type_  is anymore. However, we can manipulate its  _values_  because we understand they are all  `List`  with the same  _element type_.

### Just for kicks

Another option which the question does not discuss is to have both a bounded wildcard and a generic type for the  `List`:

```
static <E> void test(Map<?, ? extends List<E>> m) {}
```

We would be able to call it with something like a  `Map<Integer, ArrayList<String>>`. This is the most permissive declaration, if we only cared about the type of  `E`.

We can also use bounds to nest type parameters:

```
static <K, E, L extends List<E>> void(Map<K, L> m) {
    for(K key : m.keySet()) {
        L list = m.get(key);
        for(E element : list) {
            // ...
        }
    }
}
```

This is both permissive about what we can pass to it, as well as permissive about how we can manipulate  `m`  and everything in it.
