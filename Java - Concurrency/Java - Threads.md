## Threads
`Thread` are based on the **Template Method** Design pattern and the `run` method must be override. When invoked, threads cannot be invoked by their `run` method (unless you want to be synchronous). Ir order to run multi-threaded programming, the method to be invoked is **start**.

The method `start` is a method in the `Thread` class that sets up all the mechanisms for context switching. And then it calls `run`.

```java
List<MyThread> threads = Stream.iterate(0, n -> n + 1)
	,map(MyThread::new)
	.limit(10)
	.collect(Collectors.toList());

//Calling start method instead of run -> 
threads.forEach(MyThread::start);
```

## Runnable
The `Runnable` interface should be implemented by any class whose instances are intended to be executed by a thread. The class must define a method of no arguments called `run`.

A class that implements `Runnable` can run without subclassing `Thread` by instantiating a `Thread` instance and passing itself in as the target.

```java
public class CustomRunnable implements Runnable {
	private int id;
	private Thread thread = new Thread(this);

	@Override
	public void run() {
		// do something
	}


	public void start() {
		thread.start();
	}
}
```

## ExecutorService

### ExecutorService's `execute` method
```java
void execute(Runnable command)
```

Executes the given command at some time in the future. The command may execute in a new thread, in a pooled thread, or in the calling thread, at the discretion of the Executor implementation.

```java
List<CustomRunnable> listRunnables = Stream.iterate(0, n -> n + 1)
	,map(CustomRunnable::new)
	.limit(10)
	.collect(Collectors.toList());


ExecutorService service = Executor.newCachedThreadPool();
runnables.forEach(service::execute);

service.shutdown();
```

> About the above code, I've supplied all those runnables, but now I'm not dealing with the low-level threads. Instead, the executor service is managing a pool of threads on my behalf. I am submitting jobs to it and having them delegate them to threads and use the pool in an efficient way and execute everything for me.

### Executors
**Factory** and **utility** methods for Executor, ExecutorService, ScheduledExecutorService, ThreadFactory, and Callable classes defined in this package. 

**Some Methods**
- `newCachedThreadPool`() - Creates a thread pool that creates new threads as needed, but will reuse previously constructed threads when they are available.

- `newFixedThreadPool`(int nThreads) - Creates a thread pool that reuses a fixed number of threads operating off a shared unbounded queue.

- 	`newScheduledThreadPool`(int corePoolSize) - Creates a thread pool that can schedule commands to run after a given delay, or to execute periodically.

### Shutdown 
An ExecutorService can be shut down, which will cause it to reject new tasks.

- shutdown() - method will allow previously submitted tasks to execute before terminating

- shutdownNow() - method prevents waiting tasks from starting and attempts to stop currently executing tasks. 

## Callable
The _Callable_ interface is a generic interface containing a single _call()_ method â€“ which returns a generic value _V_. The result of _call()_ method is returned within a _Future_ object.

```java
public class FactorialTask implements Callable<Integer> {
    int number;
 
    // standard constructors
 
    public Integer call() throws InvalidParamaterException {
        int fact = 1;
        // ...
        for(int count = number; count > 1; count--) {
            fact = fact * count;
        }
 
        return fact;
    }
}
```
